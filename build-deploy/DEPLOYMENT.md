# Deployment Strategy

## npm Commands

### Deploy

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run deploy:test` | Uploads all files from `public/` to FTP path `/test.formula-1.dk` (serves **formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk** — the FTP folder name and the domain are deliberately different strings, unlike live where both are `formula-1.dk`), respecting `.deployignore`. After upload, runs HTTP smoke tests. Test-only files (`test-seed.php`, `sync-from-live.php`) **are** uploaded here — they live only on the test server. |
| `npm run deploy:live` | Uploads all files from `public/` to **formula-1.dk** via FTP. Requires typing `YES` at the confirmation prompt. Before uploading, creates a timestamped backup of the current live site. After upload, runs smoke tests + Playwright E2E tests. If either fails, automatically rolls back to the backup. Test-only files are excluded via `.deployignore.live`. |
| `npm run setup:deploy` | One-time interactive setup that writes FTP credentials into `build-deploy/.env`. Run this when setting up the project on a new machine. |

### Schema check

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run schema:check` | Checks the **test** DB has every table/column in `database/migrations.json`, via the `tools/schema-check.php` endpoint. Read-only, no deploy. Exits non-zero and lists the migration file(s) to run if anything is missing. |
| `npm run schema:check:live` | Same, against the **live** DB. Handy before a deploy to confirm live has been migrated. |

Deploys run this check automatically after upload (see [Schema check](#schema-check-guards-against-forgotten-migrations) below).

### Sync & Restore

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run sync:live` | Copies all data from the live database (formula-1.dk) into the test database (formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk), overwriting everything except the `settings` table. Drops any `old_` prefixed legacy tables. Useful for testing against real data. Requires `LIVE_DB_NAME` to be defined in the test server's `config.php`. |
| `npm run restore:db` | Lists all available DB backups (from `build-deploy/backups/live/`). Run with a timestamp and target to restore: `npm run restore:db -- <timestamp> [test\|live]`. Reads `db-backup.json` from the chosen backup folder and re-imports all tables into the target database. Restoring to **live** has a 5-second abort window before it proceeds. `db-restore.php` must be present on the target server — it is deployed to test automatically but **excluded from live** by default (remove it from `.deployignore.live` temporarily if you need a live restore). |

### Backup & Rollback

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `node build-deploy/backup.js` | Manually back up the live server: downloads all files from live via FTP and exports the database as `db-backup.json`. Saves to `build-deploy/backups/live/<ISO-timestamp>/`. A backup is also created automatically before every `deploy:live`. Only the 2 most recent backups are kept. |
| `node build-deploy/rollback.js` | Interactively lists available backups and re-uploads the chosen one to the live server over FTP. Rollback also runs automatically if `deploy:live` tests fail. |

### Test

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:smoke` | Fires HTTP requests against the deployed site and checks that key pages return 200. Fast, no browser. Runs automatically as part of every deploy. Target URL is read from `config.test.php` or `config.live.php`. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Runs the Playwright E2E browser tests (`smoke.spec.js`) against whichever `DEPLOY_ENV` is set. URL and credentials are read automatically from the matching `config.*.php` file. Used internally by `deploy:live`. |
| `npm run test:e2e:live` | Manually runs E2E tests against **formula-1.dk**. URL and credentials are read from `config.live.php`. |
| `npm run test:e2e:test` | Manually runs E2E tests against **formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk**. URL and credentials are read from `config.test.php`. |
| `npm run test:integration` | Runs the Playwright integration test suite against **formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk** only. Before asserting, calls `test-seed.php` to reset the test database and seed 5 races of deterministic data (3 users, 10 drivers, 15 bets). Asserts correct points totals, leaderboard order, star counts, and betting pool sizes. **Never run this against the live site — it seeds fake data.** Run manually after deploying to test. |
| `npm run test:all` | Runs `test:smoke` then `test:e2e`. Equivalent to what `deploy:live` runs automatically after upload. |

### Security

Runs OWASP-mapped security checks against the deployed site. By default targets **formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk** (test); use the `:live` variants for **formula-1.dk**.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:security` | Runs all security checks (transport, headers, cookies, access control, CSRF, info disclosure, DNS, CWE Top 25, session hardening). Rate-limit and SSL Labs checks are skipped. |
| `npm run test:security:ratelimit` | Same as above, plus tests login rate-limiting (sends 6 rapid failed attempts and expects a 429 response). Only enable when you know the scan IP is not already blocked. |
| `npm run test:security:ssllabs` | Same as base, plus queries the SSL Labs API for a full TLS grade. Takes 60–90 seconds. |
| `npm run test:security:full` | All checks enabled — rate-limit test + SSL Labs. |
| `npm run test:security:live` | Base checks against **formula-1.dk**. |
| `npm run test:security:live:ratelimit` | Rate-limit check against **formula-1.dk**. |
| `npm run test:security:live:ssllabs` | SSL Labs check against **formula-1.dk**. |
| `npm run test:security:live:full` | All checks against **formula-1.dk**. |

Reports are saved to `build-deploy/security-reports/` as `.md` and `.json` (two most recent per environment kept).

## Overview

| Environment | Site | Branch |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Local dev   | Direct file editing | `main` |
| Test        | formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk | `main` |
| Live        | formula-1.dk | `main` (only after test verified) |

---

## Local Folder Setup

You only need **one local folder** — the GitHub repo:

```
~/github/formula-1.dk/
```

Do all development here. No need for a separate live copy locally.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Develop locally
Edit files in the repo.

### 2. Commit to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "describe change"
git push
```

### 3. Deploy to test
```bash
node build-deploy/deploy.js test
```
Verify everything works on **formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk**.

### 4. Deploy to live — only when test is confirmed working
```bash
node build-deploy/deploy.js live
```

## Preventing Accidental Live Deploys

`deploy:live` requires typing `YES` exactly at the confirmation prompt — pressing Enter or any other input cancels it.

---

## What Gets Deployed

- Everything in the `public/` folder
- `config.shared.php` (from repo root) — deployed alongside `config.php` on each target server
- Respects exclusions listed in `build-deploy/.deployignore`

## Schema check (guards against forgotten migrations)

Migrations are applied manually per environment (phpMyAdmin). To stop code from going live against a DB that hasn't been migrated, every deploy runs a schema check after upload:

1. `database/migrations.json` lists every table/column the code depends on, each tagged with the migration file that introduces it. **When you add a migration, add its objects here** — otherwise a forgotten manual run won't be caught.
2. `build-deploy/schema-check.js` POSTs that list to `public/tools/schema-check.php`, which introspects the target env's own DB and reports anything missing. `deploy.js` calls this after upload; the same module powers the standalone `npm run schema:check` / `schema:check:live` commands.
3. If something is missing, the deploy fails and lists exactly which migration file(s) to run. On live it first rolls back to the pre-deploy backup.

Run `npm run schema:check:live` **before** a deploy to confirm live has been migrated (read-only, no upload). During a deploy the endpoint is uploaded earlier in the same run, so the check is active immediately — including the deploy that first introduces it. If `schema-check.php` is unreachable (404), the deploy warns and continues rather than blocking on the checker itself.

## Environment Variables

`build-deploy/.env` holds **FTP credentials only** (never committed to git):

```env
FTP_HOST=your-ftp-server.com
FTP_USER=your-ftp-username
FTP_PASS=your-ftp-password
FTP_ROOT_TEST=/path/to/test/root
FTP_ROOT_LIVE=/path/to/live/root
DRY_RUN=false
```

All other configuration (site URLs, admin credentials, seed tokens, cron secrets) lives in `config.test.php` and `config.live.php`. The build and test scripts read these files directly — no need to duplicate values in `.env`.

---

## GitHub Actions Setup

The nightly CI workflow (`nightly.yml`) runs against the live site. It cannot read `config.live.php` (that file is local only), so required values must be configured in the GitHub repo settings.

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

### Variables tab (not secrets)

| Variable | Example value |
|---|---|
| `BASE_URL_LIVE` | `https://www.formula-1.dk` |
| `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.protonmail.com` |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` |
| `SMTP_FROM` | `noreply@formula-1.dk` |

### Secrets tab

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP login username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP password |
| `REPORT_TO` | Recipient address for nightly report |
| `TEST_USER_PASSWORD_LIVE` | Admin password for E2E login on live |
