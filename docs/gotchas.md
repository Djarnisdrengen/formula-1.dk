Issues that tend to catch new developers. Read this before your first deploy.

---

## 1. `config.test.php` and `config.live.php` are not in the repo

Both files are gitignored. If you clone fresh and try to deploy, you'll get a "file not found" error from `php-config.js`. See [Getting Started → Step 2](getting-started.md#2-create-your-config-files) for the setup steps.

---

## 2. `config.shared.php` must be deployed

`config.shared.php` is committed to git and is uploaded by the deploy script automatically. If you ever manually upload PHP files (e.g. via FTP GUI), remember to also upload `config.shared.php` to the server root alongside `config.php`, or every page will fail with a fatal "require_once: failed to open stream" error.

The deploy script (`build-deploy/deploy.js`) handles this automatically — it explicitly uploads `config.shared.php` after uploading `public/`.

---

## 3. `BASE_URL_LIVE` in GitHub must be a variable, not a secret

The workflow references it as `${{ vars.BASE_URL_LIVE }}`. If stored as a secret instead, the expression evaluates to empty string and tests silently use the hardcoded fallback URL — a fragile situation. See [GitHub Actions → Variables vs Secrets](github-actions.md#variables-vs-secrets--migration) for the full explanation and migration steps.

---

## 4. Integration tests destroy the test database

`npm run test:integration` calls `tools/test-seed.php` before running, which wipes the test database and replaces it with 5 races of synthetic data (3 fake users, 10 drivers, 15 bets).

**Never run integration tests against live.** The tool is excluded from live deploys by `.deployignore.live`, but if you ever temporarily deploy it to live for debugging, remove it immediately after.

After running integration tests, the test database contains fake data. Run `npm run sync:live` to restore real data if needed.

---

## 5. `db-restore.php` is excluded from live by default

`tools/db-restore.php` is not deployed to the live server (it's in `.deployignore.live`). You must temporarily add it, restore, then remove it again. The full procedure is in [Deployment → Database restore](deployment.md#database-restore).

Leaving it on live is a security risk — anyone with `CRON_SECRET` can overwrite the live database.

---

## 6. `trim()` vs `sanitizeString()` in admin forms — an intentional asymmetry

Values stored in the database (race names, locations, settings text) go through `trim()` on save and `escape()` on output. Using `sanitizeString()` (which calls `htmlspecialchars`) on the way into the database would cause double HTML-encoding when `escape()` is applied on output.

`sanitizeString()` is correct for values that are displayed directly without a subsequent `escape()` call. `sanitizeEmail()` is correct for email addresses — it validates format, not just trims.

---

## 7. `php-config.js` only reads string defines

`build-deploy/php-config.js` parses PHP files with a simple regex that matches single-quoted string constants:
```
define('KEY', 'value')
```

It does **not** parse:
- Numeric defines: `define('SMTP_PORT', 587)` → returns `null`
- Boolean/null defines: `define('DEBUG', true)` → returns `null`
- Double-quoted strings: `define("KEY", "value")` → returns `null`

If a Node.js script needs a numeric value, read it from `process.env` or hardcode it in the script.

---

## 8. Always use `www` in URLs

`SITE_URL` in both config files must use `www` (e.g. `https://www.formula-1.dk`, not `https://formula-1.dk`). Apache redirects bare domain → www with a 301, but 301 redirects cause browsers to drop POST bodies. Any POST to a non-www URL will fail silently.

---

## 9. Cron scripts require a token — `403 Forbidden` is not a server error

The cron scripts (`import_qualifying.php`, `notifications.php`) return an error and exit immediately if the `CRON_SECRET` token is missing or wrong. If you open them in a browser without the token, you get a generic error response, not a 403 HTTP status, but the effect is the same.

Since F6, the token is sent via the `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header, not a URL query string — a plain browser visit can't set that, so use `npm run test:e2e:test` or a `fetch()`/Node one-liner instead (see `docs/cron-jobs.md` → "Triggering manually"). Both cron scripts currently also still accept the old `?token=<CRON_SECRET>` query string as a **temporary** compatibility shim while their trigger migrates from Simply.com's control-panel cron to GitHub Actions (`security-findings-remaining.md` F6) — don't rely on it, it's slated for removal once that migration finishes.

---

## 10. Session `regenerate_id()` is called on login

After a successful login, `session_regenerate_id(true)` is called. This invalidates the old session ID and creates a new one. If you are writing a test that logs in and then asserts session-dependent state, the session cookie in the test browser will be automatically updated. This is correct security behaviour — do not disable it.

---

## 11. Log directory must be writable

`public/logs/` must be writable by the PHP process. On a shared host this is usually world-writable (`777`) or group-writable depending on the host's setup.

If logs aren't being written, check permissions:
```bash
# Via FTP or SSH
chmod 755 public/logs
```

The logs are protected from direct HTTP access by `public/logs/.htaccess`.

---

## 12. `in_competition = 0` for the admin user

The service admin account (`F1_ADMIN_EMAIL`) has `in_competition = 0` in the database. This means the admin does not appear in the leaderboard and cannot place bets. This is intentional — the admin account is for management only, not for playing.

If you want an admin who also plays, create a separate regular-user account and grant it the `admin` role, or create a second user account for actual betting.

---

## 13. `quali_p1/p2/p3` must match exact bet validation

When qualifying results are entered, the bet form shows an error if the user's selected P1/P2/P3 exactly matches the qualifying order (the qualy-match rule). This validation compares driver IDs, not names. If you add qualifying results to a race in the admin panel, the P1/P2/P3 fields must be driver IDs from the `drivers` table — not display names.

The admin UI's qualifying fields use the same driver dropdowns as the bet form, so this should not be an issue in practice, but be aware of it if you write DB seeds manually.

---

## 14. Nightly report emails appear twice when `SMTP_FROM` and `REPORT_TO` share the same Proton account

On **live**, `SMTP_FROM` is `info@formula-1.dk` and `REPORT_TO` is `f1_admin@helvegpovlsen.dk` — both resolve to addresses on the same Proton Mail account. Proton treats this as a self-send and creates two copies: one stored as a sent item under `info@formula-1.dk` and one delivered to `thomas@helvegpovlsen.dk`. Any Proton filter that matches on subject will catch both copies and move them to the same folder, making it look like the email was sent twice. On **test**, `SMTP_FROM` is also `info@formula-1.dk`, and since 2026-09-21 `REPORT_TO`/`F1_ADMIN_EMAIL` is `f1_admin@formula-1.dk` (moved off `helvegpovlsen.dk`, see gotcha #15) — same domain, so the same dedup behavior now applies there too, likely for every test email test-seed.php's `send_email_preview` sends, not just the nightly report.

There is no incoming-only condition available in Proton's simple filter builder, so the duplicate cannot be eliminated by a filter alone. The fix is to either change `SMTP_FROM` to an address outside this Proton account, or change `REPORT_TO` to an external address (e.g. Gmail).

**Note:** Simply.com's mail servers also appear to act as an SMTP relay/fallback for the domain. Bounce messages from Simply.com (`localsmtp.web.simply.com`) after mail routing changes indicate that Simply.com may relay mail for `formula-1.dk` independently of the Proton MX records — for example via a mail alias or forwarding rule set up in the Simply.com control panel. Check Simply.com → Email → Forwarders when debugging unexpected mail routing.

---

## 15. `sync:live` rewrites all user emails to `+test@formula-1.dk`

When `npm run sync:live` copies the live database into test, every user email is rewritten to
`<original-local-part>+test@formula-1.dk` (any existing `+tag` already in the local part is
stripped first, so the result is always exactly one `+test` tag): `thomas@helvegpovlsen.dk`
becomes `thomas+test@formula-1.dk`, `user@gmail.com` becomes `user+test@formula-1.dk`, and so on.
`formula-1.dk` — the app's own live domain — has catch-all forwarding enabled, so any `+`-tagged
local part lands in a real inbox without provisioning anything: this is deliberate, and lets MFA
challenges (email OTP) and other email content be verified by hand for accounts copied from
production, without digging through the SMTP intercept log. It also means no rewritten address can
ever collide with an actual third-party player's real inbox.

**Moved off `hpovlsen.dk` 2026-09-21** (previously: domain-swap only, local-part preserved
verbatim, e.g. `thomas@helvegpovlsen.dk` → `thomas@hpovlsen.dk`). See the *Test site domain
migration* epic's Phase 9b for the full decision: Simply.com doesn't support email addresses on a
subdomain, which ruled out moving this to `helvegpovlsen.dk`; `formula-1.dk`'s existing catch-all
was chosen instead, using `+`-addressing so no new mailbox has to be provisioned per user/fixture.
`hpovlsen.dk` keeps its personal catch-all role unchanged — this only means *new* test-data mail
stops being routed there.

The admin account (`F1_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `f1_admin@formula-1.dk` on test as of 2026-09-21, previously
`f1_admin@helvegpovlsen.dk`) is preserved unchanged across a sync — it is saved before the wipe and
restored afterward, independent of the per-row rewrite above.

Unless SMTP intercept is on, emails to synced users **are sent for real** (captured only if you flip **Admin → Settings → Email delivery** to capture, or `touch /tmp/f1betting_smtp_intercept`). See [testing.md](testing.md). This is intentional for manual testing — but be aware that triggering a bulk action (e.g. running the notification cron) against a large synced user set will fire that many real emails at once into the same inbox.

Automated E2E fixture addresses (`e2e_*_f1+test@formula-1.dk`, seeded by `test-seed.php`) also use
`+test@formula-1.dk`, so during automated runs (`SMTP_INTERCEPT=true`) they're captured to the
JSONL log exactly like before — interception doesn't check domain — but if intercept is ever off,
fixture mail now lands in the same real catch-all inbox as synced accounts instead of failing to
deliver. Because fixtures and synced accounts share the same domain/suffix, `test-seed.php`'s
destructive actions (`cleanup_passkeys`, `set_passkey_sign_count`) can no longer rely on the
domain alone to avoid touching a synced or manually created account — they additionally require
the email's local-part to start with `e2e_`, which only seeded fixtures use.


---

## 16. MFA requires `MFA_KEY` in config, and MFA tables use the legacy `latin1` collation

The multi-factor auth system (`public/includes/mfa.php`) seals TOTP secrets at rest with a new config constant **`MFA_KEY`** — exactly 64 hex chars (32 bytes). It must be present in `config.test.php` and `config.live.php` (on the server too), alongside `PASSWORD_PEPPER`. `mfa.php` throws if it is missing or malformed — by design, so a misconfigured deploy fails loud instead of storing unsealed secrets. Generate with `php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"`.

The `users` table is legacy **`latin1_swedish_ci`**. New MFA tables (`user_totp`, `user_recovery_codes`, `user_email_otp`, `user_passkeys`) therefore pin their `user_id` foreign-key columns to `CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci` — otherwise the FK fails with error 3780 ("incompatible columns"). Keep this in mind for any future table that references `users.id`.

Apply the migration with `database/add_mfa.sql` (idempotent except the additive `users.email_otp_enabled` and `users.mfa_default_method` columns, which error harmlessly on re-run). Passkeys use the **vendored** lbuchs/WebAuthn library in `public/includes/webauthn/` — no Composer — and require the `PASSKEY_RPID` config constant (see gotcha #20).

**The preferred method leads the challenge.** The challenge screen (`mfa_challenge.php`) opens on the member's preferred method — `getMfaDefaultMethod()`, i.e. `users.mfa_default_method` if that factor is still active, else the fallback priority **passkey → totp → email**. Passkey is only the *default* preference (it's first in that priority), so an explicit preference of `totp`/`email` **wins** and opens on top; passkey then drops to the "Other options" list. Every other active method plus recovery is always rendered as a hidden panel and reachable one tap away via each panel's "Other options" list (client-side swap, no round trip). The passkey CTA is feature-detected (`passkey.js` reveals `[data-passkey-supported]`); on a device that can't use it the button hides, an "use another method" note shows, and the Other options carry the member through. Passkey on the challenge reverses the v3.0.0 removal.

**On-demand email + instant boxes:** the email OTP is **only** auto-sent at login when the resolved preferred method is `email` (`login.php`), so it's already waiting as the email panel opens. For any other preference no code is emailed until the member picks email from an "Other options" list — and that pick swaps to the boxes **immediately** while `mfa.js` fires the send in the background (never block the view on SMTP). So don't assume a login with email OTP active always sends a code, and don't reintroduce a blocking full-page POST for the email pick.

**⚠️ The automation admin account must NOT have MFA enrolled.** `build-deploy/deploy.js` smoke authed checks and `tests/global-setup.js` both log in as `F1_ADMIN_EMAIL` with a plain email+password POST. If that account has any active factor, login stops at `/mfa_challenge.php`, no session is granted, and **every authed smoke check + the entire E2E run fails** (global-setup can't save `admin.json`). If a deploy suddenly fails on `GET /profile.php [authed] → 302` or E2E dies in setup, check whether someone enrolled MFA on the admin account while testing — disable it (Profile → Security) to restore automation.

---

## 17. Test env sends email by default — interception is opt-in (E2E turns it on per run)

On the test environment `config.test.php` sets `SMTP_INTERCEPT = true`, which makes the environment *capable* of interception but does **not** enable it — **real delivery is the default**, so manual testing (e.g. sending an invite) just works. Interception is active only while the flag file `sys_get_temp_dir()/f1betting_smtp_intercept` is present.

- **E2E**: `tests/global-setup.js` turns interception **on** (`action=smtp_intercept_on`) for the run so specs capture email to the JSONL store; `tests/global-teardown.js` turns it **off** (`smtp_intercept_off`) at the end, restoring the send-by-default state.
- **Manual capture**: flip **Admin → Settings → Email delivery** to "Switch to capture" (and back). The shared helpers are `emailIntercepted()` and `smtpInterceptFlagPath()` in `public/includes/smtp.php`.
- **Live**: `SMTP_INTERCEPT` is undefined, so email always sends and the toggle is hidden.

`npm run test:resend` reads `RESEND_API_KEY` / `SMTP_FROM` / `REPORT_TO` from env vars if present, otherwise falls back to `config.<env>.php` (RESEND_API_KEY, SMTP_FROM_EMAIL, REPORT_TO→F1_ADMIN_EMAIL) — so it runs locally without a `build-deploy/.env`.

---

## 18. Migrations are manual per environment — the deploy schema check catches forgotten ones

Migrations (`database/*.sql` and inline `ALTER`s in `schema.sql`) are applied by hand in phpMyAdmin on each environment. Deploy code that references a not-yet-added column and you get a runtime fatal (e.g. `Unknown column 'quali_date'`), not a deploy failure — unless the object is registered for checking.

`deploy.js` guards this: after upload it POSTs `database/migrations.json` to `public/tools/schema-check.php`, which introspects the target DB. Missing objects fail the deploy (and roll back on live) with the exact migration file(s) to run. **When you add a migration, add the tables/columns it introduces to `database/migrations.json`** or the check can't see them. See `build-deploy/DEPLOYMENT.md → Schema check`.

---

## 19. The test-environment banner is gated by `APP_ENV` — never loosen the guard

`public/includes/header.php` renders a yellow "Dette er en testhjemmeside" banner only when `APP_ENV === 'test'`. The banner is only ever allowed on formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk — never formula-1.dk (owner decision, 2026-07-05). The guard is server-side config, deliberately **not** `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` (client-controlled). Don't remove the guard, don't switch it to Host-header sniffing, and don't raise the banner's `z-index` above the nav drawer's 30. The `deploy:live` E2E gate (`tests/e2e/01-smoke.spec.js`) asserts the banner is absent on live and rolls back the deploy if it isn't. Full spec: `epics/design_handoff_test_banner/`.

---

## 20. Passkeys are bound to `PASSKEY_RPID` — a one-way door per environment

Every passkey is cryptographically bound to the WebAuthn relying-party id: the **registrable domain**, `formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk` (test) / `formula-1.dk` (live), set as `PASSKEY_RPID` in each config. **Changing it after members have registered orphans every passkey silently** — logins just stop working. That's why `passkeyRpId()` (`public/includes/passkey.php`) fails loud unless the constant is present *and* matches the domain derived from `SITE_URL`: a config edit that changes the domain becomes an immediate error, not silent orphaning.

Consequences to keep in mind:

- **Test and live credentials are not interchangeable** — a passkey registered on formula-1.helvegpovlsen.dk can never sign in on formula-1.dk, and vice versa.
- **`sync:live` clears `user_passkeys` on the test copy** (`sync-from-live.php`, verified fail-loud by `sync.js`). Live rows would be unusable on test *and* would gate those members' test logins behind a factor that cannot be satisfied — `passkeyActive()` feeds `userHasActiveFactor()`, which triggers the two-step login.
- **Registration and challenge verification must always ship together.** A member's *first* `user_passkeys` row immediately gates their password login, so a deploy that carries registration without the `mfa_challenge.php` passkey block + `webauthn.php` verify actions locks that member down to recovery codes.
- **Sign counts are advisory.** Most platform authenticators always report 0; the clone check in `passkeyAssertVerify()` only rejects when both stored and new counters are non-zero. Don't "harden" it into a lockout — you'd lock out every iCloud/Google-synced passkey.
- The vendored library is pinned in `public/includes/webauthn/VERSION`; bump it only via the documented update procedure (re-copy, diff, rerun `tests/unit/passkey-harness.php` + the auth E2E suite).

---

## 21. Every `.hf-drawer-row` needs its own active-state check — there's no shared mechanism

The burger drawer (`public/includes/header.php`) highlights the current page with `.hf-drawer-row.active` (background tint, coloured icon, red trailing bar via `.hf-drawer-row.active::after`). There's no central logic that derives this from the URL — **each row does it itself**, inline: `class="hf-drawer-row <?= $currentPage === 'races' ? 'active' : '' ?>"`.

Copy-pasting a row without updating that string is silent: the link still works, the icon renders, nothing errors — it just never highlights, on any page, ever. This exact bug shipped on the `challenges-board.php` row (added without the check) and went unnoticed until someone visited that page and asked where the marker was.

When adding a new drawer row, always include `$currentPage === '<page-basename-without-.php>' ? 'active' : ''` — match it against the other rows in the same file, don't assume it's inherited from anywhere.

---

## 22. A stray test race can hijack `getNextDuelRace()` for every duels user

`getNextDuelRace()` (`public/includes/challenges.php`) picks a single race for the whole Duels tab — the globally soonest upcoming row in `races`, full stop, with no concept of "this one's just an E2E fixture":

```sql
SELECT * FROM races WHERE TIMESTAMP(race_date, race_time) > NOW()
ORDER BY race_date ASC, race_time ASC LIMIT 1
```

`44-duels.spec.js` seeds a race named `E2E Duel Test Race` scheduled at `NOW() + 2h` (`test-seed.php`'s `seed_duel_race` action) and normally deletes it by name in its own `afterEach`/`afterAll` (`cleanup_challenges`). If a run dies before teardown — or two runs race each other, since the delete matches by name, not a run id — that row survives, and because "+2 hours" is almost always sooner than any real `test: <Grand Prix>` row, it becomes the "next" duel race for **everyone**, including a human tester manually clicking Quick Match. Symptom: a real participant queues, never pairs (nobody else is routed to their actual race anymore), and a second real participant's Quick Match instead pairs them with a leftover e2e fixture account. This is the same class of bug as the home hero's "globally next race" collision (`index.php`'s hero picks the globally-next race the same way) — a single global "next X" query with no separation between real and test-seeded rows.

Fix once found: delete the stray race directly — it cascades via FK to `duels`/`duel_predictions`/`duel_quickmatch` automatically, so nothing else needs cleaning up by hand. `npm run sync:live` now also clears this as routine maintenance (see gotcha below), so a sync is a reasonable first thing to try if Duels looks haunted — though it won't help *between* syncs, since nothing runs continuously to catch a stray race the moment it's left behind.

---

## 23. `sync:live` also wipes `challenge_participants` — there's no live copy to restore it from

Paddock Challenges has never been deployed to live (see `docs/paddock-challenges-reference.md`), so unlike `users`/`races`/`drivers`/`bets`, `sync-from-live.php` has nothing to copy back in for `challenge_participants` — it's a pure `DELETE FROM challenge_participants`, no recopy step. This exists specifically to stop stray test/fixture participants from accumulating across syncs (see gotcha #22 above for how one such straggler once hijacked Quick Match).

Because the FKs cascade, this single delete also clears: `challenge_points`, `challenge_magic_links`, `challenge_access_tokens`, `challenge_invites`, `challenge_answers`, `duels`, `duel_quickmatch`, `duel_predictions`, `challenge_trivia_answers` — i.e. every participant's CP ledger, tokens, duels, and answers, gone with them.

**Deliberately left alone:** `challenge_items` / `challenge_trivia_questions` (editorial rumor/trivia content — not participant data, and wiping it would disrupt manual QA of the admin review/publish flow) and `challenge_email_suppressions` (the opt-out/bounce list exists specifically to *persist* across resets — clearing it risks re-emailing someone who already opted out).

If you're testing Paddock Challenges and your participants vanish after a `sync:live`, this is why — not a bug, and there's no way to opt out per-participant.

---

## 24. A hand-built POST to a bulk-delete/bulk-update handler needs `ids[]`, not repeated `ids`

`admin-challenges.php`'s bulk actions (`bulk_delete_rumor`, `bulk_delete_trivia`, `bulk_delete_participants`, `bulk_delete_duels`, ...) all read `(array) ($_POST['ids'] ?? [])`. When a real `<form>` submits checkboxes named `ids[]`, PHP already builds `$_POST['ids']` as an array and this works exactly as it looks. But a script POSTing by hand (`curl`, `fetch`, a Node `URLSearchParams`/manual body) that sends the field as plain repeated `ids=x&ids=y&ids=z` — no brackets — gets a very different, silent result: PHP's form parser only treats a field as an array when the *name itself* carries `[]` (or an explicit index like `ids[0]`). Repeated bare `ids=` keys just overwrite each other, so `$_POST['ids']` ends up a single scalar string — whichever value happened to land last — and `(array) $scalar` then wraps *that one value* in a one-element array. The handler runs successfully (200/302, no error, `admin_ch_bulk_updated` flash message and everything), it just silently only touched one row instead of all of them.

Caught while cleaning up after `bin/simulate-challenges.js` (see `docs/paddock-challenges-reference.md`): a hand-rolled cleanup POST looked like it worked (redirect, no error) but a follow-up count showed only 1 of 52 rumor items and 1 of 54 trivia items were actually gone. Fix: build the body with bracket notation per id — `ids%5B%5D=<id1>&ids%5B%5D=<id2>&...` (`%5B%5D` is `[]` URL-encoded) — and always verify a bulk operation's actual effect afterward (a count before/after, not just the HTTP status), the same way you'd want a bulk migration verified.

## 25. Sessions are DB-backed, not PHP's default file sessions

`config.shared.php` registers `DbSessionHandler` (`public/includes/session-handler.php`) via `session_set_save_handler()` **before** its `session_start()` call, storing session rows in the `sessions` table instead of local disk. This replaced plain file sessions after live reports (2026-09) of getting logged out every few minutes on formula-1.dk during a single tab of manual refreshing — a pattern that ruled out the app's own idle/absolute timeout (`SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT`/`SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT`, `functions.php`) since refreshing resets `last_activity` every time. Nothing in this repo ever set `session.save_path` or `session.gc_maxlifetime`, so file-session lifetime was entirely up to Simply.com's hosting — plausibly not shared correctly if requests land on more than one app server. MySQL is the one backend already trusted as shared state across however many servers exist, so sessions moved there.

Consequences to know about:

- The handler opens its **own** PDO connection (not `getDB()`) because `config.shared.php` registers it before `functions.php` (where `getDB()` lives) is required — one extra MySQL connection per request, accepted as a small cost.
- Cleanup is **not** PHP's per-request probabilistic `session.gc` (unreliable by design, and part of what got us here) — it's the dedicated `public/cron/session_gc.php` cron (hourly, `.github/workflows/cron-session-gc.yml`), which deletes rows past `SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT`.
- `sessions` is a normal migration-gated table (`database/add_sessions.sql`, registered in `database/migrations.json`) — forgetting to run it on an environment fails loud via the deploy schema check (gotcha #18), not silently.
- `public/paddock-rumors/query.php` used to call a bare `session_start()` of its own before `config.php` was even required — that started a session under PHP's *default* file handler before `DbSessionHandler` got registered, silently defeating this fix for that one endpoint (and was already logging harmless-but-noisy "session already active" warnings). Removed; that page now gets its session from `config.php`'s chain like every other page. If you add a new entry point, don't call `session_start()` yourself — `require config.php` and let `config.shared.php` do it.

## 26. Conditional-mediation WebAuthn must stay scoped to `login.php`, and e2e specs must stub it off

`public/assets/js/passkey.js`'s `loginConditional()` fires `navigator.credentials.get({mediation:'conditional'})` unconditionally on `init()`, gated only by the `[data-passkey-login]` DOM marker — which currently renders only on `login.php`. Never remove that guard or call `loginConditional()` from a page-specific script on `profile.php` or `mfa_challenge.php`: `passkey.js` is loaded on both, and an anonymous discoverable-credential login attempt firing on `mfa_challenge.php` in particular would race an unrelated passwordless login against a two-step challenge already mid-flight in `$_SESSION['mfa_pending']`.

Two independent e2e traps follow from the same feature:

- Chromium's CDP virtual authenticator (`WebAuthn.addVirtualAuthenticator`) does not enforce the spec's real-user-gesture requirement before resolving a conditional `get()`. With `automaticPresenceSimulation: true`, any pending conditional request auto-resolves the instant a matching resident credential exists — no simulated tap, no real interaction — which will race ahead of a test's own explicit button-click or password-submit steps and complete the login first, mid-test.
- Plain headless Chromium reports `isConditionalMediationAvailable()` as `true` even with **no** virtual authenticator attached at all — enough on its own to fire a background `login_options` call and plant a fresh session challenge in a test that assumed none would exist.

Fix: every spec that navigates to `/login.php` stubs the capability check off via `disableConditionalMediation(page)` (`tests/helpers/webauthn.js`), called before any `page.goto()`. `tests/e2e/auth/35-passkey.spec.js` and `36-passkey-negative.spec.js` both do this in `beforeEach`; the handful of tests written specifically to exercise the conditional path (`CU-01`/`CU-02`/`CU-04` in `35-passkey.spec.js`) re-enable it deliberately, per-test, after the blanket stub already ran.
