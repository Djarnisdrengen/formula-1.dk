Answers the question: *How do we think about testing, and how do I add a new test?*

For commands and what each spec covers, see [testing.md](testing.md).

## Strategy Principles

These govern every decision when adding or changing a test.

1. **Test at the right layer** — test the smallest unit that can meaningfully fail. Don't write E2E to cover what a unit test can prove.
2. **Each spec owns its data** — seed in `beforeAll`, clean up in `afterAll`. No spec depends on another spec's data or execution order.
3. **No DB wipes** — the full-wipe integration approach is banned. Targeted seed/cleanup only.
4. **Test env only for mutations** — nothing that creates, changes, or deletes data ever runs against Live.
5. **One assertion per email type** — each email type is tested once, in the spec that triggers it. No separate "email spec" that duplicates assertions from other specs.
6. **Shared code, not shared state** — helpers are pure functions shared via `require`. State (`seedData`, sessions) stays local to the spec that needs it.
7. **Numbered filenames = explicit order** — specs run in filename order. Numbers document intent and dependency.
8. **Fail fast** — smoke first, auth second. If the app is down or login is broken, later specs won't mislead.

## The Two Stacks

The test suite is not one unified system — it is two separate stacks that share a single config source but nothing else. Understanding which stack you are working in tells you exactly how config, credentials, and shared code flow.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH                                             │
│  config.test.php / config.live.php  (not in git)                   │
│  build-deploy/php-config.js  (reads the PHP constants into Node)    │
└────────────────┬───────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                 │                           │
                 ▼                           ▼
┌───────────────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│  STACK A — Playwright E2E │   │  STACK B — Standalone scripts     │
│                           │   │                                   │
│  playwright.config.js     │   │  smoke.js                         │
│    ↓ sets process.env.*   │   │  security/security.js             │
│  global-setup.js          │   │  email-preview.js                 │
│    ↓ (also reads          │   │  nightly-report.js                │
│       php-config directly │   │                                   │
│       as a safety net)    │   │  Each reads php-config.js         │
│  fixtures/index.js        │   │  directly. No shared helpers.     │
│  helpers/seed.js          │   │  Self-contained by design.        │
│  helpers/email.js         │   │                                   │
│  helpers/markers.js       │   │  On GitHub Actions: falls back    │
│  e2e/**/*.spec.js         │   │  to process.env (GH Secrets)      │
│                           │   │  since php-config is absent.      │
│  On GitHub Actions:       │   │                                   │
│  playwright.config.js     │   └───────────────────────────────────┘
│  falls back to GH Secrets │
└───────────────────────────┘
```

**Rule: helpers in Stack A are not usable from Stack B**, and vice versa.
`helpers/seed.js` reads `process.env.BASE_URL` and `process.env.INTEGRATION_SEED_TOKEN` which are only set after `playwright.config.js` evaluates. Calling `seed.js` from a standalone script leaves those vars empty. It is Playwright-stack-only by design.

`email-preview.js` runs as `node tests/email-preview.js` — it is Stack B. It reads `php-config.js` directly, the same way `smoke.js` does. It must not import `helpers/seed.js`.

## Architecture Layers (Stack A only)

```
Layer 4 — Specs          tests/e2e/**/*.spec.js
                         ↓ use
Layer 3 — Fixtures       tests/fixtures/index.js      (Playwright fixture extensions)
                         ↓ use
Layer 2 — Helpers        tests/helpers/seed.js        (seed API wrapper)
                         tests/helpers/email.js       (email polling + assertDelivered)
                         tests/helpers/markers.js     (e2e_markers parsing)
                         ↓ use
Layer 1 — Config         playwright.config.js         (reads php-config → sets process.env)
                         global-setup.js              (also reads php-config directly — safety net)
```

All four layers run identically in all three Stack A contexts:
- **Terminal** (`npm run test:e2e:test`): php-config.js reads config.test.php
- **Deploy pipeline** (`deploy.js` → `test:e2e:test`): same as terminal
- **GitHub Actions (nightly)**: playwright.config.js falls back to GH Secrets when php-config.js is absent

### Layer 1 — Config

`playwright.config.js` reads `php-config.js` and sets `process.env.*` before any spec or fixture runs. `global-setup.js` also reads `php-config.js` directly as a safety net, then sets the same env vars. Both fall back to `process.env` for GitHub Actions where PHP config files are absent.

No spec or helper ever reads `php-config.js` directly — they only read `process.env.*`.

### Layer 2 — Helpers

**`tests/helpers/seed.js`**

Centralises seed calls as a pure Node `fetch` wrapper — no browser page needed for API calls.

```js
// Every seed call — 1 line:
seedData = await seed.bettingRace();

// API shape:
seed.bettingRace()     → { ok, raceId, email, password, drivers }
seed.authUser()        → { ok, email, password }
seed.scoreRace()       → { ok, raceId, driverIds, expectedPoints }
seed.notifyOpen()      → { ok, raceId, emails, bettingWindowHours }
seed.notifyClose()     → { ok, raceId, emails }
seed.registerInvite()  → { ok, email, token }
seed.e2eUser(params)   → { ok, email, password }
// + seed.cleanup.* matching every seed above
```

**Error contract:** All functions throw if the HTTP response is non-200 or `body.ok !== true`. Callers never check `ok` — a failed seed throws immediately, failing `beforeAll` with a clear message. Cleanup functions also throw on non-200 so broken teardowns are never silently swallowed.

**`tests/helpers/email.js`** (re-exports `tests/helpers/intercepted-mail.js`)

```js
// Assert email delivery in one call — reads the server-side SMTP intercept log:
assertDelivered(inbox, _apiKey, { count=1, timeout=20000 })
// Returns msgs array; throws on timeout. (_apiKey is a vestigial no-op — pass null.)

// Baseline approach — poll for messages that arrived after a snapshot:
waitForNewMessages(inbox, baselineIds, count, _apiKey, { timeout })
// Take a baseline snapshot before triggering the action, poll for new IDs only
```

Interception is the only backend: `global-setup.js` enables it (`smtp_intercept_on`) and
clears the log; these helpers read it back via `test-seed.php?action=get_test_emails`.

**`tests/helpers/markers.js`**

```js
parseMarkers(text)              → { 'invite-sent': 'true', 'invite-to': 'email@...', ... }
expectMarker(text, key, value)  → throws with clear message if missing or wrong
```

### Layer 3 — Fixtures

`tests/fixtures/index.js` extends Playwright's `test` with an `adminPage` fixture that applies admin `storageState` automatically. Admin specs import from `../../fixtures` instead of declaring `storageState` themselves.

**What is NOT a fixture:** seed data, user sessions created mid-test. Those stay local to the spec using `beforeAll`/`afterAll`.

**Unauthenticated context override:** Tests inside an admin spec that need a fresh session use `test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })` inside a nested `test.describe`. Playwright resolves `storageState` at the innermost scope — the admin fixture does not interfere.

---

## Test Inboxes (SMTP intercept)

Every test address uses the `+test@formula-1.dk` tag/domain (same as `sync:live`-synced users);
emails are captured server-side to the intercept log during automated runs and never sent
via SMTP — interception is domain-agnostic, so this holds regardless of domain. `global-setup.js`
clears the **entire** log once before the suite runs — there is no per-inbox purge and no
plan/account limit. Assert with `assertDelivered`/`waitForMessages` (absolute count) or
`waitForNewMessages` (baseline snapshot before triggering the action).

| Inbox | Spec | Email type |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e_auth_f1+test@formula-1.dk` | `02-auth.spec.js` | Forgot-password reset link |
| `e2e_testing_invite_f1+test@formula-1.dk` | `admin/11-invites.spec.js` | Invite to register |
| `e2e_testing_testuser_f1+test@formula-1.dk` | `admin/12-users.spec.js` | Admin-issued password reset |
| `e2e_bet_delete_f1+test@formula-1.dk` | `admin/12-users.spec.js` | Bet-deletion notification |
| `e2e_notify_open_in_f1+test@formula-1.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` real-run | Betting window open |
| `e2e_notify_close_a_f1+test@formula-1.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` real-run | Betting window closing soon |

`test:email:preview` renders all email types to `F1_ADMIN_EMAIL` via the same intercept and
writes HTML to `tests/email-previews/`. See [testing.md](testing.md) for the full inbox list.

## Adding a New Test

### Which stack?

- Writing a Playwright spec (`*.spec.js`)? → **Stack A.** Use `helpers/seed.js`, `helpers/email.js`, `helpers/markers.js`, `fixtures/index.js`.
- Writing a standalone Node script (`node tests/mything.js`)? → **Stack B.** Read `php-config.js` directly. Do not import Stack A helpers.

### New user-facing feature (Stack A)

1. Add seed/cleanup action to `test-seed.php` if data is needed
2. Add typed wrapper to `helpers/seed.js`
3. Add a numbered spec (e.g. `08-newfeature.spec.js`) — picked up automatically by `testMatch` glob
4. **Tag its `test.describe` block with `{ tag: '@<suite-slug>' }`** — which of the 12 suites in
   `docs/testing.md`'s [Suites](testing.md#suites) table does this belong to? An untagged spec
   still runs in the legacy/full-glob path, but silently drops out of its suite's `npm run
   test:e2e:<suite>` and the orchestrator's per-suite counts — the orchestrator's orphan check
   (MUST-1, `epics/Optimize test suite structure/plan.md`) will fail the run if you forget.
5. If the feature sends email: assert with `assertDelivered()` in the feature's spec (the intercept log is cleared automatically by `global-setup.js` — no per-inbox setup needed)

### New admin feature (Stack A)

1. Same `seed.js` pattern
2. Add `admin/14-newfeature.spec.js`
3. Import `{ test, expect }` from `../../fixtures` — admin auth applied automatically
4. Tag it, same as above (admin specs mostly fall under `@admin` — check `docs/testing.md`'s
   suite table if unsure)

### New email type (Stack A)

1. Assert markers with `expectMarker()` + `assertDelivered()` in the spec that triggers the action — not in a separate email spec
2. For visual review (Stack B): update `send_email_preview` in `test-seed.php`, re-run `npm run test:email:preview`

### New security check (Stack B)

1. Add to `tests/security/security.js` in the appropriate existing section (A–L)
2. No new file needed

### New standalone script (Stack B)

1. Read credentials via `php-config.js` directly (see `smoke.js` as the pattern)
2. Fall back to `process.env` for GitHub Actions
3. Do not import `helpers/seed.js` or `fixtures/index.js`
