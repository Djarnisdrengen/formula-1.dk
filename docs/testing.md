## Overview

| Command | Stack | What it checks | Target | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `npm run test:smoke` | B | Key pages return 200 and contain expected content | test or live | ~5s |
| `npm run test:unit` | B | Mailer transport logic (no network), plus small PHP CLI harnesses: passkey vectors, duel 5/2/0 scoring, `isRaceHeroWindow()` D9 boundaries | local | ~1s |
| `npm run test:e2e:test` | A | Full user journeys — login, betting, admin, scoring, email delivery — 12 suites run sequentially | test | ~5 min (measured) |
| `npm run test:e2e:<suite>` | A | One suite standalone (see [Suites](#suites) below) | test | a few seconds–~1m45s |
| `npm run test:e2e:live` | A | Smoke suite only — read-only live health check | live | ~30s |
| `npm run test:resend` | B | Sends one email directly via Resend API; verifies backup transport is operational | live | ~5s |
| `npm run test:email:preview` | B | Renders all 20 email types locally as HTML files for manual visual review | test | ~30s |
| `npm run test:security` | B | OWASP headers, cookies, access control, CWE Top 25 | test or live | ~30s |
| `npm run test:all` | B+A | smoke + unit + e2e:test | test | ~10 min |

Stack A = Playwright (browser-based, reads config via `playwright.config.js`).
Stack B = standalone Node scripts (read config directly from `php-config.js`, fall back to `process.env` on GitHub Actions).

---

## Suites

The 339 E2E tests are partitioned into 12 UX-oriented suites via Playwright's native
`{ tag: '@slug' }` on each `test.describe` block (`tests/playwright.config.js`'s `projects`
array greps by tag) — zero files moved, zero test bodies changed. Each suite is independently
runnable via `npm run test:e2e:<suite>` and produces its own pass/fail result. Full background
in `epics/Optimize test suite structure/epic-e2e-test-restructure.md` and `plan.md` (that epic's
own counts — 175 tests, 11 suites — are a dated snapshot from when it landed; `admin` and
`appearance` have since grown with the Dashboards area and nav-shell work, and `challenges` was
added later as a 12th suite for Paddock Challenges. Durations below are re-measured against
current `main`, not the epic's original numbers).

| Suite (npm slug) | Source file(s) | Tests | `:live`? | Measured duration (standalone) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `smoke` | `01-smoke`, `15-env-banner` | 21 | **Yes** | ~9s |
| `auth` | `02-auth`, `auth/30,31,32,35,36` | 49 | No | ~99s (slowest — 49 serial tests) |
| `registration` | `03-registration`, `admin/11-invites` | 6 | No | ~4s |
| `predictions` | `04-betting` | 5 | No | ~3s |
| `scoring` | `admin/13-scoring` | 12 | No | ~6s |
| `race-page` | `14-race-page` | 16 | No | ~3s |
| `admin` | `admin/10-content`, `admin/12-users`, `admin/12-email-delivery`, `06-emails`, `admin/14-*`, `admin/15-20-dashboards-*` | 66 | No | ~25s |
| `profile` | `05-profile` | 17 | No | ~9s |
| `appearance` | `08-preferences`, `10-nav-shell` | 26 | No | ~19s |
| `preferences-editor` | `09-profile-preferences` | 15 | No | ~10s |
| `cron` | `07-cron` | 11 | No | ~5s |
| `challenges` | `challenges/40,42,43,44,46,47,48,49,50` | 95 | No | ~102s (2nd slowest) |
| `mobile` (standalone only, secondary tag) | inline viewport tests, already inside their home suites | 17 (reused, not double-counted in the full run) | No | ~2s |

Full orchestrated run (`npm run test:e2e:test`, `tests/run-e2e-suites.js`) measured at **~5
minutes total**, sequential. `auth` and `challenges` together account for the majority of total
run time — `auth`'s 49 tests run serially with real SMTP round-trips, `challenges`'s 95 tests
span the full Paddock Challenges surface (participant access, rumor/trivia/duels play, admin
authoring, invite guardrails, home hero, content auto-publish); they're the first candidates if
the full run ever needs to get faster.

**`predictions` (5 tests) covers bet *placement*** — pre-race display of odds/pool/countdown
lives in `race-page` (16 tests). The small count in `predictions` isn't a coverage gap.

**Only `smoke` gets a `:live` script** (`npm run test:e2e:smoke:live`) — every other suite
mutates data (bets, users, races, passwords), and `docs/test-strategy.md` principle 4 forbids
mutating Live. `npm run test:e2e:test:legacy` runs the full 339 in one un-tagged invocation
(pre-restructure behavior, kept as a rollback path).

---

## Smoke Tests

```bash
npm run test:smoke
```

Fires HTTP GET requests, asserts 200 and content. Fast, no browser, no seeds.

**Unauthenticated checks:**

| Page | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `/` | HTML renders |
| `/login.php` | Email input present; "Adgangskode" label visible (default language DA) |
| `/leaderboard.php` | Page contains "leaderboard" |
| `/races.php` | HTML renders |

**Authenticated checks** (skipped if credentials unavailable):

| Page | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `/profile.php` | Betting history heading visible (DA or EN) |
| `/profile.php` | Change-password heading visible (DA or EN) |

Runs automatically at the end of every `deploy:test` and `deploy:live`.

---

## E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
npm run test:e2e:test              # full suite against test env — 12 suites, sequential, via the orchestrator
npm run test:e2e:<suite>           # one suite standalone, e.g. test:e2e:profile — see Suites above
npm run test:e2e:live              # smoke suite only, against live
npm run test:e2e:smoke:live        # same as above, explicit
npm run test:e2e:test:legacy       # single un-tagged invocation, all 339 tests (rollback path)
npm run test:e2e:test:no-auth      # full run minus Authentication (~99s, one of the two slowest suites)
```

`E2E_SKIP_SUITES` (comma-separated slugs) drives the exclusion — `test:e2e:test:no-auth` is just
`E2E_SKIP_SUITES=auth`. Set it yourself for other combinations, e.g.
`E2E_SKIP_SUITES=auth,cron node tests/run-e2e-suites.js`. Purely a run-scope choice: the
orphan/drift check (MUST-1) still validates all 339 tests across all 12 tags regardless of what
this run skips, and cumulative-progress % rescales to whatever subset is actually running.

Config: `tests/playwright.config.js`. Screenshots on failure: `build-deploy/screenshots/`.
Full-run orchestration: `tests/run-e2e-suites.js` — spawns each suite as its own Playwright
process, strictly sequential, with cross-suite progress (`Suite k of 12 — cumulative X/339`).
It self-checks that every test is tagged into exactly one primary suite before running anything
(an untagged spec or a typo'd tag fails the run loudly rather than silently vanishing), and
distinguishes a crashed leg from one with real test failures via a paired JSON reporter per leg.

**Email interception** — real delivery is the default on the test env; interception is opt-in. `tests/global-setup.js` turns it on for the duration of the run (`test-seed.php?action=smtp_intercept_on`, creating `/tmp/f1betting_smtp_intercept`) so emails are captured to `/tmp/f1betting_test_emails.jsonl` and read back via `test-seed.php?action=get_test_emails`; `tests/global-teardown.js` turns it off (`smtp_intercept_off`) at the end. No real emails are sent while the suite runs. Under the orchestrator, only the first leg purges/toggles and only the orchestrator's own `finally` block toggles off at the end (so a crashed leg can't strand interception on for other developers); a standalone `npm run test:e2e:<suite>` run always does the full purge/toggle itself, exactly like before this restructuring.

For manual testing, email sends for real by default. To capture instead, flip **Admin → Settings → Email delivery** to "Switch to capture" (or `touch /tmp/f1betting_smtp_intercept` on the server; remove it to resume sending).

**On test:** all `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.js` and `tests/e2e/admin/**/*.spec.js` files matching the numbered glob are discoverable; which ones actually run is narrowed further by the selected suite's tag (`--project=<slug>`).
**On live:** the live-safety `testMatch` gate in `tests/playwright.config.js` makes only `01-smoke.spec.js` discoverable at all, regardless of `--project` — defense in depth ahead of the tag/project layer.

**Concurrency:** the orchestrator does not support two runs against the same test env at once — the shared test DB, the cached `.auth/admin.json` session, and the SMTP-intercept toggle are all single-run-at-a-time resources. The session file is written atomically (temp file + rename) so a concurrent run can't observe a half-written file, but that's a corruption guard, not a concurrency guarantee — don't run two `test:e2e:*` invocations against test at the same time.

### Architecture layers

```
tests/fixtures/index.js           — Playwright fixture: adminPage (applies admin storageState)
tests/helpers/seed.js             — typed wrappers for all test-seed.php actions (Node fetch, no browser)
tests/helpers/intercepted-mail.js — email helper: waitForMessages, waitForNewMessages, assertDelivered (intercept mode)
tests/helpers/markers.js          — parses e2e_markers strings emitted by admin.php in test mode
tests/helpers/webauthn.js         — disableConditionalMediation(page): stubs isConditionalMediationAvailable() off
```

`seed.js` is Stack A only — it reads `process.env.BASE_URL` set by `playwright.config.js`. Do not import it from standalone scripts.

---

### `02-auth.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Seeds a dedicated user (`seed.authUser()` / `seed.cleanup.authUser()`). Forgot-password email captured via intercept and asserted in-suite.

**Login**

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Wrong password | Error alert visible |
| Correct credentials | Redirect to `index.php` |

**Forgot password**

| Test | Asserts |

| Reset via token link | Navigate to reset link from marker; set new password; login succeeds |

**Password change via profile**

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Wrong current password | Error alert visible |
| Mismatched confirm | Error alert visible |
| Correct inputs | Success alert visible |

---

### `03-registration.spec.js`

Test env only.

**Invalid token**

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| No token | Error alert visible; password input absent |
| Unknown/expired token | Error alert visible; password input absent |

**Valid invite flow** (serial, seeded)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Form pre-fills email | Email matches invite; password input visible |
| Successful registration | Redirect to `index.php?success=welcome`; logout link visible |

---

### `04-betting.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Seeds a race and in-competition user (`seed.bettingRace()`).

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Place a bet | Submit → redirect to `index.php?success=bet_placed`; success alert |
| Bet confirmation email | Intercepted mail: subject has race name; body has domain, P1–P3 drivers in picked order, timestamp |
| Attempt to bet again | Redirect contains `already_bet` |
| Edit a bet | Swap P1/P3 → redirect to `index.php?success=bet_updated`; success alert |
| Update confirmation email | Intercepted mail: "updated" subject with race name; body has domain, swapped picks in order, timestamp |
| Duplicate driver | Same driver in two positions → validation error |

---

### `05-profile.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Seeds a dedicated user (`seed.e2eUser()`).

Password tests click the Security tab before filling fields (tab panel is hidden by default). Language tests use the Preferences tab toggle; language is no longer a select in the Profile form. All password-change redirects land on `?tab=tab-security` so the correct tab is active after submit.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Empty bet history | No-bets card visible |
| Wrong current password | Security tab → error alert |
| Mismatched new passwords | Security tab → error alert |
| Correct password change | Security tab → success alert |

| Language — survives re-login | After logout/login `html[lang]="en"` |
| Language — switch back to Danish | Preferences tab → Danish toggle → `html[lang]="da"` |

---

### `06-emails.spec.js`

Test env only. Verifies the SMTP/Resend config page. No email-sending assertions (those live in the spec that triggers the action).

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Unauthenticated access denied | Body contains "Access denied" |
| Admin can access page | HTTP 200 |
| Config table shows required keys | SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_FROM_EMAIL, RESEND_API_KEY visible |
| RESEND_API_KEY is configured | Row shows masked value; "Not defined" absent |

---

### `07-cron.spec.js`

Test env only.

**Import qualifying** (serial, seeded)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Unauthorized without token | "Unauthorized access" in body |
| Test mode imports results | "[SUCCESS] Updated qualifying results"; "Total races updated: 1" |

**Notifications — access control**

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Unauthorized without token | "Unauthorized access" in body |
| Authorized with CRON_SECRET | "Notification check complete"; no "FAILED to send" |

**Notifications — betting just opened** (serial, seeded, `?test=true`)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| In-competition user notified; others get pool reminder | "Betting opened for: E2E Notify Open Race"; competing user sent open notification; non-competing user sent pool reminder; pending invite sent pool reminder with registration link; `[pool] 150`; `[lang] en` |

**Notifications — betting closing soon** (serial, seeded, `?test=true`)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Unbetted user notified; betted user skipped | "Betting closing soon for: E2E Notify Close Race"; unbetted user in output; betted user absent; `[lang] en` |

**Notifications — betting just opened (real send)** (serial, seeded)

Runs real cron without `?test=true`. Asserts intercepted email delivery.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Betting-open email delivered to in-competition inbox | Cron output confirms send; `e2e_notify_open_in_f1@hpovlsen.dk` receives 1 intercepted message |

**Notifications — betting closing soon (real send)** (serial, seeded)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Betting-close email delivered to unbetted inbox | Cron output confirms send; `e2e_notify_close_a_f1@hpovlsen.dk` receives 1 intercepted message |

---

### `08-preferences.spec.js`

Test env only. Covers the full preference lifecycle: new-visitor defaults (AC1), returning anonymous visitor via cookie (AC2–AC3), first-login profile seeding (AC4), returning-login profile override (AC5), authenticated in-session sync (AC6), logout continuity (AC7–AC9), last-write-wins on overwritten cookie (AC10), and theme icon correctness (AC11).

`beforeAll` triggers the global seed (resets Alice + Bob + Charlie to NULL prefs), then pre-sets Bob's theme to `light` for the AC5 override test.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| AC1 — new visitor defaults | Body class `dark font-system`; `f1_theme=dark` and `f1_font=system` cookies set |
| AC2 — returning anonymous visitor | Pre-set `f1_theme=light` cookie → body class `light` |
| AC3 — anonymous toggle persists | Toggle → cookie updated → survives reload |
| AC4 — first login seeds profile | Login as Alice (NULL prefs) → DB seeded with session values; body class unchanged |
| AC5 — returning login overrides | Login as Bob (DB `light`) with dark cookie → body class `light`; cookie updated |
| AC6 — authenticated toggle syncs to DB | Toggle while logged in → `get_prefs` confirms DB updated; survives re-login |
| AC7+AC8 — logout preserves cookies | After logout: `f1_theme` cookie still present; body class unchanged on next page |
| AC9 — return visit after logout | `storageState` snapshot → new context → body class matches pre-logout prefs |
| AC10 — overwritten cookie wins | Overwrite cookie in saved state → body class matches overwritten value |
| AC11 — theme icon current state | Dark → `fa-moon`; light → `fa-sun` in theme toggle |

**Test-seed action used:** `get_prefs` — returns `{theme, font_stack, language}` from the DB for a given email. Used to assert server-side state without re-logging in.

---

### `09-profile-preferences.spec.js`

Test env only. Covers the Profile Page Preferences Management feature: bottom nav hidden on profile page, Preferences tab visible and pre-populated with toggle buttons, saving theme+font+language via form updates body class/cookies/DB immediately, and full regression coverage confirming the bottom nav remains functional on all other pages.

Profile page uses a tabbed layout (Profile / Security / Preferences). Tests that interact with form fields first click the relevant tab button to reveal the hidden panel. Preference selects have been replaced with segmented toggle buttons backed by hidden inputs; tests click toggles and assert `#pref_theme` / `#pref_font` hidden input values post-redirect. Language is now saved via the Preferences tab (same form as theme+font), not the Profile tab. Saving preferences redirects to `?tab=tab-preferences`; saving on Security tab redirects to `?tab=tab-security`.

`beforeAll` (serial group) triggers the global seed to reset Alice to NULL prefs before the state-dependent tests.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| PP1 — bottom nav hidden on profile | `.hf-bottom` not attached on `/profile.php` (authenticated) |
| PP2 — preferences tab visible | Click Preferences tab → panel visible; theme and font toggle buttons visible |
| PP3 — save light+editorial | Click Preferences tab → toggle light+editorial → body class `light font-editorial`; flash visible; `#pref_theme` / `#pref_font` hidden inputs show updated values |
| PP4 — DB updated | `get_prefs(alice)` → `theme='light'`, `font_stack='editorial'` |
| PP5 — cookies updated | `f1_theme=light`, `f1_font=editorial` after save |
| PP6 — survives re-login | Fresh login as Alice → body class still `light` |
| PP7 — bottom nav on / | `.hf-bottom` visible on `/` (regression) |
| PP8 — bottom nav on races | `.hf-bottom` visible on `/races.php` (regression) |
| PP9 — theme toggle on / | `?toggle_theme=1` changes body class on non-profile page (regression) |
| PP10 — unauthenticated visitor | `.hf-bottom` visible on `/`; contains login link |
| PP-NEW-1 — special chars in display name | Click Profile tab → fill name → stored and rendered without double-encoding |
| PP-NEW-2 — PRG: no resubmit on reload | Click Profile tab → save → reload → no success flash |
| PP-NEW-3 — tampered pref_theme rejected | Click Preferences tab → tamper `#pref_theme` hidden input → body class is `dark` or `light`, not `malicious` |
| PP-NEW-4 — display name max-length | Click Profile tab → 101-char name → error alert, no success alert |
| PP-NEW-5 — language via preferences toggle | Click Preferences tab → English toggle → `html[lang]="en"`; DB `language='en'` |

**Test-seed action used:** `get_prefs` (same as `08-preferences.spec.js`).

```
GET /tools/test-seed.php?token=...&action=get_prefs&email=alice@test.local
→ {"theme":"dark","font_stack":"system","language":"da"}
```

---

### `admin/10-content.spec.js`

Test env only. Admin auth applied via fixture.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Create and delete a race | Form → success alert; race card appears; delete → card gone |
| Create and delete a driver | Form → success alert; driver card appears; delete → card gone |

---

### `admin/11-invites.spec.js`

Test env only. Invite email captured via intercept and asserted in-suite.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Invite a user and delete | Success alert; `[invite-sent] true`; intercepted email delivery asserted; delete → invite gone |

---

### `admin/12-email-delivery.spec.js`

Test env only. Toggles **Admin → Settings → Email delivery** between capture and live-send.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Toggle flips capture ↔ live and reflects status | Starts "Capturing" (global-setup forces it on); click flips to "Sending real"; click again returns to "Capturing" |

`afterAll` force-re-enables interception (`smtp_intercept_on`) regardless of outcome, so later specs in the same run keep capturing mail.

---

### `admin/12-users.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Seeds a user (`seed.e2eUser(language=en)`). Password reset email captured via intercept and asserted in-suite.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Toggle in competition | Button state flips |
| Toggle admin role | Badge cycles `user → admin → user` |
| Set password | Success alert; `[admin-reset-lang] en`; `[admin-reset-sent] true`; intercepted email delivery asserted |
| Update display name | User logs in, updates name → success alert; input reflects new name |
| Delete user | Confirm-modal delete → user card gone |

---

### `admin/13-scoring.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Seeds two races and 3 users (`seed.scoreRace()` / `seed.cleanup.scoreRace()`).

Race A: future date, result already set by seed (no perfect bet, pool carries to Race B).
Race B: day after Race A, no result yet — test enters it via admin UI.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Enter Race B result via admin | Select P1/P2/P3 → success alert |
| Leaderboard points after Race B | Each user's total points matches expected from seed |
| Star badge for perfect bet | Alice's leaderboard row shows star badge |
| Race B pool includes Race A carryover | `poolA + poolB` shown on Race B card |
| Race A pool unchanged | `poolA` shown on Race A card |
| Reset button scope | Race A: no reset button; Race B: reset button visible |
| Reset Race B | Confirm → Race B result gone, reset button gone; leaderboard rolled back to Race A baseline |

**`Scoring — mobile podium`** — a separate `describe` block in the same file, tagged
`@mobile` alongside `@scoring`. Own seed: `seed.scoreRace({ prescored: true })`, which scores
Race B directly instead of relying on the "enter Race B result via admin" test above — needed
so `npm run test:e2e:mobile` can select this one test on its own and still have a scored race
to check (MUST-7, `epics/Optimize test suite structure/plan.md`).

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Podium visible on mobile viewport (375px) | `.hf-podium-strip` visible against a directly-seeded, already-scored Race B |

---

### `14-race-page.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Covers the single-race focus page (`public/race.php`) across its lifecycle
states. Seeds one **open** race (with qualifying timing) and one **completed** race plus scored bets
via `seed.racePage()` / `seed.cleanup.racePage()`. Manages its own anon + logged-in contexts (the
logged-in user is the in-competition account returned by the seed).

Open race: `race_date` +2h, `quali_date` +1h, no results, pool 250, **two unscored bets**.
Completed race: qualifying + race results set, dates in the past, pool 300 (`bettingpool_won`), with a
perfect bet (30 pts), a non-perfect bet (8 pts), and the **login user's own 0-pt scored bet** (P1 uses
an accented-surname driver, "Hülkenberg").

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Open — countdowns ticking | Schedule box shows quali (`fa-stopwatch`) + race (`fa-flag-checkered`) `.countdown-timer[data-target]`, none `.done` |
| Open — meta + pool | Qualifying meta line (`fa-stopwatch`, no prefix); pool row shows `250` with `.bettingpool_size` |
| Open — result placeholders | Two `.result-pending`, zero `.position-badge` |
| Open, logged out — login affordances | `.race-login-mini` + `.race-login-cta` visible, both link to `login.php?redirect=` |
| Open, logged in competitor | No login affordances; `bet.php?race=` place-bet CTA shown |
| Open — 320px | No horizontal scroll (`scrollWidth ≤ clientWidth`) |
| Completed — countdowns done | Two `.countdown-timer.done`, zero `[data-target]` |
| Completed — results | Zero `.result-pending`, six `.position-badge`, two `.quali-row` |
| Completed — pool won | `.hf-racename .hf-badge` (pool-won) in title |
| Completed — bets scored/sorted | Three `.bet-item`; highest-points perfect bet sorts first with `.perfect-bet` + `★` + `30` pts badge |
| **v2.4.0** Surname chips | Done-race chips show full surnames (Hamilton/Verstappen/Leclerc); accented "Hülkenberg" renders intact |
| **v2.4.0** YOU tag / "— pts" negatives | Logged-out done race: zero `.race-you-tag`, zero `.race-pts-pending` (scored) |
| **v2.4.0** Own bet (logged in) | `.bet-item.my-bet` has `.race-you-tag` + a **"0 pts"** badge (scored 0-pt → badge, not `— pts`) |
| **v2.4.0** Unscored bets | Open race: two `.race-pts-pending` ("— pts"), zero `.hf-badge.soon` points badges |
| **v2.4.0** Two-column results | At 1280px the two `.race-results-two` children share y (±2px) / differ in x; at 375px they stack |
| **v2.4.0** `races.php` regression | `races.php` has zero `.race-you-tag` / `.race-pts-pending`, surname chips intact (flag-gated, no leak) |

**Test-seed actions used:** `seed_race_page` / `cleanup_race_page` (creates races *E2E Race Page Open*
and *E2E Race Page Done*, 3 in-competition users, and the accented-surname driver).

### `15-env-banner.spec.js`

Runs on test only (`test.skip` on `DEPLOY_ENV === "live"` in both blocks — the banner is
server-side gated to `APP_ENV === 'test'`). No seeds.

**Test-environment banner**

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Renders on public pages (AC-TB-01) | `.test-banner` visible with the expected DA/EN text on `/`, `/login.php`, `/races.php` |
| Stays pinned below the header on scroll (AC-TB-02) | Banner top offset tracks the header's bottom edge after scrolling |
| No horizontal scroll, single-line plate at 320px (AC-TB-05, AC-TB-06) | `scrollWidth ≤ clientWidth`; `.test-banner-plate` height stays under 36px |
| Open mobile drawer stacks above the banner (AC-TB-06) | Drawer `z-index` greater than the banner's |

**Test-environment banner — admin pages**

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Renders on the admin panel (AC-TB-01) | `.test-banner` visible with the expected text on `/admin.php?tab=races` |

---

### `auth/30-totp-mfa.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Fresh user per suite (`seed.authUser()` / `seed.cleanup.authUser()`). Contains a minimal RFC 6238 TOTP generator that mirrors `includes/mfa.php` so the spec can compute valid codes itself.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Password-only login reaches index (regression) | No factor enrolled → straight to `index.php`, no challenge |
| Cancel authenticator setup | Enrollment panel closes; setup button reappears; pending enrollment is dropped |
| Enroll authenticator, see recovery codes once | Recovery-codes panel visible and does **not** auto-hide like an `.alert` (asserted with a deliberate 6s wait); dismiss removes it; a reload does not bring it back |
| Single factor skips the method list (AC-MFA-05) | Challenge opens directly on the TOTP panel — no `mfa-view-root` list |
| Protected page denied while pending (bypass guard) | Jumping to `/profile.php` before completing the challenge bounces to `/login.php` — no session from the password step alone |
| Wrong code rejected inline (AC-MFA-07) | Error alert; stays on `mfa_challenge.php` in the single-method view |
| Correct code promotes the session | Redirect to `index.php`; `/profile.php` now reachable |
| Disable requires the password | Correct current password required; status flips to "Not enabled" |

---

### `auth/31-email-otp.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Fresh user per suite. Reads OTP codes from the SMTP intercept log (`tests/helpers/intercepted-mail.js`), matching the 6-digit code in the subject/body.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Cancel email-OTP setup | Enrollment panel closes; setup button reappears |
| Enable via emailed confirmation code | Code arrives by intercepted mail; status flips to Active; recovery codes shown once (first factor) |
| Login pre-sends a code, single factor skips the list (AC-MFA-05) | Challenge opens directly on the email panel; `.code-sent` shown; a code is confirmed in the inbox |
| Protected page denied while awaiting the code (bypass guard) | `/profile.php` bounces to `/login.php` before the code is submitted |
| Correct emailed code promotes the session | Redirect to `index.php`; `/profile.php` reachable |
| Wrong emailed code is rejected | Error alert; stays on the challenge |
| Disable requires the password | Status flips to "Not enabled"; next login has no challenge |

---

### `auth/32-mfa-default-method.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial (25s timeout — email pre-send blocks on SMTP). Fresh user that enrolls **both** TOTP and email OTP, exercising the preferred-method selection described in [gotchas.md #16](gotchas.md#16-mfa-requires-mfa_key-in-config-and-mfa-tables-use-the-legacy-latin1-collation).

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Enrolling a 2nd factor reveals the preferred-method selector | `mfa-default-method` control appears only once ≥2 factors are active |
| No stored preference → first active factor leads (AC-MFA-01/05) | TOTP panel opens directly; email + recovery reachable via "Other options"; nothing emailed on landing |
| Picking email from Other options shows boxes immediately (AC-MFA-04) | Status reads "sending" before the code exists, then flips to "code sent" once it arrives — the view is never blocked on SMTP |
| Setting email as preferred pre-sends on login; no resend on browse | `login.php` sends the code before the challenge renders; switching panels back to the already-sent email view never re-sends (guards the MFA-scope rate-limit budget, now separate from login's — see `security-findings-remaining.md` F7) |

**`MFA challenge — mobile (AC-MFA-09)`** — a separate `describe` block in the same file,
tagged `@mobile` alongside `@auth`. Own seed: `seed.mfaEnrolledUser()`, which creates a user
with TOTP + email OTP already active directly at the data layer, instead of relying on the
"enroll BOTH..." test above — needed so `npm run test:e2e:mobile` can select this one test on
its own and still reach `mfa_challenge.php` (MUST-7, `epics/Optimize test suite structure/plan.md`).
The assertions are primary-method-agnostic by design, so a fresh pre-enrolled user is equivalent.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| No horizontal scroll at 320px (AC-MFA-09) | Card doesn't overflow; whichever panel is preferred opens directly, and its boxes, confirm button, and "Other options" row all keep ≥44px tap targets |

---

### `auth/35-passkey.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial (25s timeout — shared account; email/SMTP round-trips need headroom). Fresh user re-seeded `beforeEach` (FKs cascade every factor away). Uses Chromium's CDP virtual authenticator (`ctap2`/`internal`, resident key + user verification, automatic presence) — real credentials can't be seeded server-side, so every test enrolls through the profile UI on its own page. **Not part of smoke.**

`beforeEach` also calls `disableConditionalMediation(page)` (see gotcha #26) so the conditional-UI background request never races this file's own explicit login steps. The three `CU-*` tests below deliberately re-enable it.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Password-only login reaches index (regression) | No factor yet → straight to `index.php` |
| Register a passkey; first factor shows recovery codes once (REG-01/REG-02) | Status Active; codes visible once, gone after dismiss + reload |
| Passkey is primary on the challenge; tapping it promotes the session (CHA-01/CHA-02) | Passkey panel + ceremony button lead (reverses the v3.0.0 removal); only recovery sits beneath the button for a passkey-only member |
| Passwordless login from the login page (PWL-01) | Feature-detected button; no email/password — straight to a session |
| Rename a passkey (management) | Friendly name updates in the row |
| Sign-count regression rejected on the passwordless login path (SEC-01) | Forcing the stored counter above what the authenticator reports next → login error, no promotion |
| Preferred method leads; the other is one tap away (CHA-04/CHA-05) | An explicit TOTP preference outranks the passkey default and leads the challenge; switching the preference back to passkey flips which panel leads |
| Sign-count regression rejected on the challenge path too (SEC-02) | Same guard as SEC-01, exercised through the challenge's passkey button |
| Passkey leads by default with no email pre-sent (CHA-06) | Passkey panel opens (default priority, no explicit preference); nothing emailed until picked from Other options, then boxes appear instantly with a "sending" → "code sent" status flip |
| WebAuthn unsupported: button hidden, TOTP fallback works (CHA-07) | `window.PublicKeyCredential` deleted client-side → passkey CTA stays hidden, an unsupported note takes its place, and the TOTP fallback still completes the challenge |
| Recovery code is the break-glass while a passkey is primary (CHA-08) | Dropping to recovery from the passkey panel redeems a code and promotes the session |
| Admin strips two-step factors; member returns to password-only (support path) | Admin's "remove MFA" action (Users tab) clears the member's passkey; button disappears; the member's next login skips the challenge entirely |
| Revoke requires the password; removing it restores password-only (REV-01/REV-02) | Wrong password leaves the row in place; correct password removes it and restores password-only login |
| Conditional UI logs in without an explicit click (CU-01) | Re-enables the stub; page load alone (no click, no submit) reaches `index.php` via `navigator.credentials.get({mediation:'conditional'})` |
| Explicit passkey button aborts a pending conditional request (CU-02) | `page.route()` holds the background `login_options` call open; the explicit button's own flow still completes cleanly — proves `conditionalCancelled` stops the held chain from reaching `get()` after the click |
| Conditional UI enabled, no credential: password login unaffected (CU-04) | No virtual authenticator attached; normal password login still reaches `index.php` with zero uncaught page errors from the unresolved background attempt |

---

### `auth/36-passkey-negative.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial. Bypass and enumeration-parity negatives for `webauthn.php` — no virtual authenticator needed, since every case must fail before crypto is ever evaluated. POSTs go through in-page `fetch()` (`page.evaluate`), not `page.request`: the Simply.com WAF challenges non-browser network stacks (see [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) / memory "no curl"), while the browser's own fetch is already past that check. True valid-assertion replay is covered separately by challenge single-use in `tests/unit/passkey-harness.php`.

`beforeEach` calls `disableConditionalMediation(page)` (see gotcha #26) — plain headless Chromium reports `isConditionalMediationAvailable()` true with no virtual authenticator attached at all, which would otherwise plant a session challenge ahead of this file's own explicit `login_options` calls (e.g. PWL-03).

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Missing CSRF token blocked on every action (SEC-03) | All 6 `webauthn.php` actions reject without a valid token; no session |
| `challenge_verify` without `mfa_pending` grants nothing (CHA-03) | Error response; no session |
| `login_verify` without a prior challenge grants nothing (PWL-02) | Error response; no session |
| Challenge is single-use (PWL-03) | First garbage assertion consumes the challenge; a replay of the same payload also fails — nothing left to consume |
| `register_options` requires a logged-in session (REG-04) | Error response when logged out |
| All failure modes return the byte-identical generic body (PWL-04 parity) | 5 distinct failure paths (no-pending, no-challenge, bad-credential after valid options, unknown action, logged-out register) all return the exact same response body — no failure mode is distinguishable from the outside |

`afterAll` also clears `login_attempts` — the garbage `login_verify` posts each record a failed attempt, and would otherwise rate-limit a re-run (or global-setup's admin login) within the 15-minute window.

---

### `auth/37-passkey-nudge.spec.js`

Test env only. Serial (25s timeout). Fresh user re-seeded `beforeEach`. Covers the one-time post-login enrollment nudge (`includes/passkey-nudge.php`) — branch-1 scope only (password-only login, zero active second factors), per the epic's resolved Scope decision. **Not part of smoke.**

`beforeEach` also calls `disableConditionalMediation(page)` for the same reason as `35-passkey.spec.js`.

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Password-only login with zero passkeys shows the nudge once (NDG-01) | Visible right after login; gone after a reload — single-read, not just dismissed |
| Dismissing the nudge removes it immediately (NDG-02) | Client-side `.remove()` — panel gone from the DOM with no reload |
| Member with a passkey never sees the nudge, via the second-factor challenge (NDG-03) | `userHasActiveFactor()` routes login through `mfa_challenge.php`, not branch 1 — the flag is never written |
| Member who logs in via the passwordless button never sees the nudge (NDG-05) | Different code path from NDG-03: `webauthn.php`'s `login_verify` → `passkeyPromoteSession()`, which also never writes the flag |
| 2FA member without a passkey does not see the nudge (NDG-04) | TOTP-only enrollment still routes through the challenge branch — locks in the branch-2-out-of-scope decision as a regression guard |

---

## Email Preview

```bash
npm run test:email:preview
```

Standalone Stack B script. Calls `test-seed.php?action=send_email_preview` which renders all 17 email types in DA + EN (34 total). Prints a formatted summary (name, to, subject, extra fields) and writes HTML files to `tests/email-previews/{timestamp}/`. Not pass/fail — exit 0 always. Use it for manual visual review of email templates after copy or layout changes.

The action always sends via `sendEmail()`, so whether these are captured or actually delivered depends on `SMTP_INTERCEPT`'s flag file state at call time (see gotcha #17) — not on this script. The response JSON always includes each email's rendered HTML regardless, so the preview files get written either way; check `test-seed.php?action=get_test_emails` (0 entries = nothing was intercepted, i.e. these were real sends) if you need to know which mode was active for a given run.

Open the generated HTML files in a browser to inspect the rendered emails:

```bash
xdg-open tests/email-previews/$(ls tests/email-previews | tail -1)/1_password_reset_en.html
```

---

## Resend Health Check

```bash
npm run test:resend
# requires: RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx SMTP_FROM=noreply@... REPORT_TO=you@... npm run test:resend
```

Standalone Stack B script (`build-deploy/verify-resend.js`). Calls `makeResendSender()` from `mailer.js` directly — no SMTP involved — and sends a single test email via the Resend API. Exits 0 on success, 1 on failure.

**Purpose:** verify the Resend backup transport is operational before it is ever needed as a fallback. The nightly CI job runs this as a dedicated step after the main nightly report, so a broken Resend configuration (revoked key, account issue, API change) is caught daily rather than discovered during an SMTP outage.

**CI:** runs automatically as the `Verify Resend backup transport` step in `.github/workflows/nightly-tests.yml`. All required env vars (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `SMTP_FROM`, `REPORT_TO`) are available at job level in that workflow.

| Scenario | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Valid key + reachable API | Logs `[verify-resend] OK`; exits 0; email delivered to `REPORT_TO` |
| Invalid key / API error | Logs `[verify-resend] FAILED: ...`; exits 1 |
| Missing env vars | Logs which vars are absent; exits 1 |

## Test Email Addresses

All seeded test users use `@hpovlsen.dk` addresses — the same domain `sync:live` rewrites synced live users to (catch-all forwarding to a real inbox, see [gotchas.md #15](gotchas.md#15-synclive-rewrites-all-user-emails-to-hpovlsendk)). During automated runs `SMTP_INTERCEPT=true` on the test server, so emails are captured server-side and never actually sent via SMTP regardless of domain — interception is domain-agnostic. The domain choice only matters if intercept is ever manually disabled (e.g. `Admin → Settings → Email delivery`): fixture mail then delivers for real into the same catch-all inbox as synced accounts, instead of silently failing against the old non-routable `test.localhost` placeholder.

Because fixtures and synced live accounts now share a domain, `test-seed.php`'s destructive actions (`cleanup_passkeys`, `set_passkey_sign_count`) gate on the `e2e_` local-part prefix in addition to the domain, so they can still never match a synced or manually created account — see [gotchas.md #15](gotchas.md#15-synclive-rewrites-all-user-emails-to-hpovlsendk).

**Email delivery by command:**

| Command | Email delivery |
|---|---|
| `test:e2e:test` | Captured to JSONL — no real send |
| `test:security` | None — HTTP scanner only, no emails triggered |
| `test:email:preview` | Captured to JSONL — HTML files written locally |
| `test:resend` | Real Resend API send to `REPORT_TO` (verifies backup transport) |

### Inboxes asserted in E2E tests

`global-setup.js` clears the entire intercept log before the suite runs. Tests use `waitForMessages` (absolute count) or `waitForNewMessages` (baseline-snapshot) to assert delivery.

| Inbox | Triggered by | Email type |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e_auth_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `02-auth.spec.js` | Password reset link |
| `e2e_testing_invite_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `admin/11-invites.spec.js` | Invite to register |
| `e2e_testing_testuser_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `admin/12-users.spec.js` | Admin-issued password reset |
| `e2e_bet_delete_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `admin/12-users.spec.js` | Bet deletion notification |
| `e2e_notify_open_in_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` | Betting window open |
| `e2e_notify_close_a_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` | Betting window closing soon |

### All seeded inbox addresses

| Inbox | Spec | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e_register_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `03-registration.spec.js` | Invite recipient / registering user |
| `e2e_bet_user_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `04-betting.spec.js` | Betting user |
| `e2e_score_alice_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `admin/13-scoring.spec.js` | Alice (perfect-bet user) |
| `e2e_score_bob_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `admin/13-scoring.spec.js` | Bob |
| `e2e_score_charlie_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `admin/13-scoring.spec.js` | Charlie |
| `e2e_notify_open_out_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` | Non-competing user (pool reminder) |
| `e2e_notify_open_invite_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` | Pending invite (pool reminder) |
| `e2e_notify_close_b_f1@hpovlsen.dk` | `07-cron.spec.js` | Already-bet user (notification skipped) |

Users synced from live via `sync:live` also have their email addresses rewritten to `@hpovlsen.dk` (local-part preserved), landing in the same catch-all inbox as the e2e fixtures above. The admin account (`F1_ADMIN_EMAIL`) is restored unchanged.

## How tests find credentials

All test scripts use `build-deploy/php-config.js` to read `config.test.php` or `config.live.php` directly. No `.env` file or environment variables needed when running locally.

On GitHub Actions (no PHP config files), tests fall back to `process.env` variables set as GitHub Secrets. See [GitHub Actions](github-actions.md).
